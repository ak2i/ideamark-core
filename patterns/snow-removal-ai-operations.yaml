title: AI Optimization of Snowplow Deployment in Heavy Snow Cities
type: urban_service_optimization
context:
- Cities with persistent winter snowfall struggle with limited snowplow fleets
- Real-time traffic and weather conditions vary widely across districts
problem:
  summary: Inefficient routing and scheduling leads to uneven snow removal and higher costs
solution:
  approach: Deploy AI to predict snowfall intensity and optimize snowplow dispatch and routing
