# IdeaMark Core

**IdeaMark** is a framework for encoding complex problems — from social infrastructure to business model pivots — as structured, reusable knowledge blocks.  
It enables AI-human collaboration in recognizing, composing, and evolving solutions by connecting patterns across domains.

This repository provides the core schema, examples, and tools for authoring and integrating IdeaMark templates.
