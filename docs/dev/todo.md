# TODO

## Template/Section Governance (Draft)
- Draft a lightweight RFC-like process for adding or changing template sections.
- Define a minimal set of standard section keys and a namespace strategy for domain-specific variants.
- Prototype template usage by generating IdeaMark documents from real scenarios and evaluate searchability.
- Validate how section naming impacts mechanical processing and LLM interpretation.
