# MCP-Compatible LLM Services Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of LLM services that support the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. It is intended to guide the integration of these services with a locally hosted MCP-compatible server, such as one used for document updates based on conversational interactions.

## Services Reviewed
- OpenAI (GPT series)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Mistral AI
- Google (Gemini)

## Comparison Table

| Feature | OpenAI | Anthropic | Mistral | Google |
|--------|--------|-----------|---------|--------|
| **MCP Support** | âœ… Official | ðŸ§ª Beta (via `mcp_servers`) | âœ… Official | ðŸ”œ Planned (Gemini 2.5+) |
| **API Style** | `Responses API` with `tools` field | `Messages API` with `mcp_servers` array | `Agents API` or SDK | SDK / Vertex AI Chat API |
| **Authentication** | API Key | API Key + optional OAuth for MCP server | API Key | Google Cloud (OAuth2 / ADC) |
| **Context Handling** | Stateful (managed by OpenAI) | Stateless (manual history) | Stateful Agent | Mixed, evolving |
| **Model Compatibility** | GPT-4, o-series | Claude Sonnet 4 | Mistral Medium 3+ | Gemini 2.5 Pro+ |
| **Tool Invocation** | Yes (auto-chain during reasoning) | Yes (MCP tool calls in API) | Yes (Agent uses tools) | Yes (tool server registration planned) |
| **Docs & SDKs** | [OpenAI Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs) | [Anthropic Docs](https://docs.anthropic.com) | [Mistral Docs](https://docs.mistral.ai) | [Google AI Docs](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs) |

## Notes

- **OpenAI**: Best current support with fully stateful `Responses API`. Supports multi-turn conversations with external tool integrations.
- **Anthropic**: Requires `mcp_servers` in JSON and beta headers. Powerful Sonnet 4 model supports long context and tool use.
- **Mistral**: Agent-style SDK and REST APIs. Fully supports registering MCP-compatible tool servers.
- **Google**: Gemini 2.5+ will support MCP natively, but general access is staged. Vertex AI tools integration is coming.

## Use Case: Local Document Update Server

When building a local chat server that updates documents based on interactions, MCP enables secure, multi-agent collaboration:
- Define tool handlers locally (e.g., Markdown updater, JSON patch tool).
- Connect the MCP server via standard tool declaration JSON.
- Integrate LLMs by registering their tool server endpoint using each API's MCP mechanism.

This setup ensures you can:
- Route model requests through tools.
- Abstract input-output interfaces across providers.
- Maintain a consistent context for interactions regardless of model backend.

## Recommendations

| Use Case | Best Provider |
|----------|---------------|
| Rapid prototyping | OpenAI |
| Long-context reasoning | Anthropic |
| Lightweight, open agents | Mistral |
| Deep integration w/ Google Cloud | Google |
