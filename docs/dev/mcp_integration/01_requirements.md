# MCP Server Requirements

The MCP server is responsible for exposing IdeaMark pattern operations in a stateless, versioned manner that enables AI agents to interact with structured knowledge patterns. Requirements derive from [mcp_integration.md](../mcp_integration.md).

## Self‑Descriptive Elements

MCP servers advertise **Tools**, **Resources**, and **Prompts** so that clients can dynamically discover available capabilities. These elements are language‑agnostic – a server might be implemented in Python, Node.js, Deno, or any other runtime. Clients use `tools/list`, `resources/list`, and `prompts/list` RPC methods to obtain metadata about available functions and data sources before invoking them.

```
GET /mcp/v1/tools/list    → returns callable tool definitions
GET /mcp/v1/resources/list → lists accessible URIs or context blobs
GET /mcp/v1/prompts/list  → exposes reusable prompt templates
```

This self‑description is central to MCP’s flexibility. For example, a Node.js server could return a set of JavaScript functions with JSON schemas for input, while a Python server could expose the same functionality via asyncio coroutines. Agents decide which tool to call based on these definitions rather than hard‑coded endpoints.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Pattern Operations
- **Pattern Retrieval**: Fetch individual patterns by ID from various sources (GitHub, local filesystem, HTTP URLs)
- **Pattern Storage**: Save new or updated patterns with validation and access control enforcement
- **Pattern Validation**: Validate pattern content against the IdeaMark schema before storage
- **Reference Generation**: Auto-generate `.ref.yaml` files from pattern content with proper metadata
- **Pattern Merging**: Combine multiple patterns using configurable merge strategies and LLM assistance
- **Pattern Search**: Query patterns by keywords, tags, or metadata with relevance ranking

### Access Control & Security
- **Visibility Enforcement**: Respect `access.visibility` flags (`public`, `private`, `restricted`) when serving content
- **Authentication**: Support token-based authentication with read/write scope differentiation
- **Authorization**: Implement role-based access for pattern modification and restricted content
- **Audit Logging**: Track all operations with user identification and content source attribution

### Data Integration
- **Multi-Source Loading**: Support GitHub repositories, local filesystems, and HTTP endpoints
- **Schema Compliance**: Enforce IdeaMark schema validation using existing `PatternValidator`
- **LLM Integration**: Leverage configured LLM providers for merge conflict resolution and content synthesis
- **Fallback Strategies**: Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable

### Content Management
- **Version Tracking**: Maintain pattern version history and change attribution
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle merge conflicts using LLM-assisted strategies
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Auto-populate metadata fields during pattern creation and updates
- **Link Management**: Maintain referential integrity between patterns and their references

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **Response Time**: API endpoints must respond within 5 seconds for standard operations
- **Throughput**: Support at least 100 concurrent requests for read operations
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capability through stateless design
- **Caching**: Implement intelligent caching for frequently accessed patterns

### Reliability
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime for production deployments
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error responses with detailed error codes and messages
- **Retry Logic**: Built-in retry mechanisms for external service calls
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures when dependencies are unavailable

### Security
- **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement per-user rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all security-relevant events

### Operational
- **Containerization**: Deploy as lightweight Docker containers
- **Statelessness**: No server-side session state between requests
- **Health Monitoring**: Expose health check endpoints for orchestration platforms
- **Metrics**: Provide Prometheus-compatible metrics for monitoring

### Integration Requirements

#### Existing Component Integration
- **PatternValidator**: Utilize `lib/merge/validators.py` for schema validation
- **PatternMerger**: Leverage `lib/merge/core.py` for pattern combination operations
- **PatternLoader**: Use `lib/io/pattern_loader.py` for flexible content loading
- **LLM Providers**: Integrate with `lib/llm/providers.py` for AI-assisted operations
- **Configuration**: Use `lib/utils/config.py` for centralized configuration management

#### External Service Integration
- **GitHub API**: Support GitHub repository access with token authentication
- **LLM Services**: Compatible with OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Google (Gemini), and local LLM endpoints; dynamic provider selection enables adding new providers via configuration
- **File Systems**: Support both local and network-mounted storage backends
- **Monitoring**: Integration with standard observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana)

## Compliance Requirements

### Data Governance
- **Content Attribution**: Distinguish between human-authored and AI-generated content
- **License Compliance**: Respect CC0 licensing for public patterns
- **Privacy**: Handle private patterns according to data protection regulations
- **Retention**: Implement configurable data retention policies

### API Standards
- **REST Compliance**: Follow REST principles for resource-oriented design
- **OpenAPI**: Provide OpenAPI 3.0 specification for all endpoints
- **Versioning**: Support API versioning with backward compatibility
- **Content Negotiation**: Support JSON and YAML response formats

These requirements ensure the MCP server can integrate cleanly with AI agents, maintain data integrity, and scale to support collaborative pattern development workflows.
