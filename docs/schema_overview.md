# IdeaMark Schema Overview

## Purpose

The **IdeaMark Schema** was developed to enable structured, reusable documentation of complex societal, industrial, and business challenges — and the conceptual solutions to those challenges — in a way that is both machine-readable and human-meaningful.

Its central aim is to support **AI-human collaboration** in the design and evaluation of systemic interventions. Inspired by the tradition of _pattern languages_ (as pioneered by Christopher Alexander), this schema brings such reusable design patterns into a format suitable for:

- Semantic synthesis by LLMs
- Human discussion across disciplines
- Incremental composition and merging of ideas
- Strategic planning based on multidimensional pattern networks

## Why It Was Created

In many domains — from disaster response to local infrastructure, from small business pivots to global ecological shifts — practitioners face complex problems that do not lend themselves to point solutions.

Yet, often, fragments of solutions do exist:
- Community initiatives
- Research-backed interventions
- Business model innovations
- Local experiments

What lacks is a **shared grammar and structured representation** for expressing, sharing, and recomposing these fragments — especially when AI is involved.

**IdeaMark** addresses this gap by:
- Encoding the _context_, _problem_, and _solution_ structure explicitly
- Linking patterns through hierarchical and referential relationships
- Embedding metadata that informs scale, domain, and geography
- Supporting both human authorship and AI reasoning via YAML/JSON/Markdown

## How It Is Used

An IdeaMark file is:
- Authored in YAML (or converted from JSON/Markdown)
- Stored in a Git-based repository or document store
- Referenced by ID and access URI
- Optionally linked to other patterns (children, siblings, derivations)

It can be:
- Queried by tags or scale (e.g., “regional patterns in rural mobility”)
- Composed with others to synthesize a novel intervention
- Merged through human-AI assisted conflict resolution
- Visualized as a knowledge graph for systems thinking

## Broader Vision

The schema is the backbone of an emerging **pattern network**, where:
- Policymakers, designers, activists, and AI systems can operate on shared knowledge
- Design ideas can be reused across context boundaries
- Machine agents can recommend, combine, or test ideas in silico
- A community of contributors can publish and evolve patterns openly

This is not just a technical spec — it's a **cognitive tool for civilization-level design collaboration**.
