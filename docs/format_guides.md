# IdeaMark Format Guides

This document explains how to write and use IdeaMark files, focusing on the two primary formats:

- Full Pattern Files (`.yaml`)
- Reference Entries (`.ref.yaml`)

---

## ðŸ“˜ Full Pattern Format (`.yaml`)

These files live in the `/patterns/` directory and follow the `ideamark.schema.yaml` specification.

They include all essential fields for:

- Contextual understanding
- Problem/solution expression
- Compositional metadata
- AI- or human-led merging

### Key Fields

```yaml
id: IdeaMark-<UUID>
title: Example Pattern Title
type: digital_commerce_model
author: your-name@domain.com
context: [...]
problem:
  summary: ...
  factors: [...]
solution:
  approach: ...
  components: [...]
  examples: [...]
access:
  uri: https://github.com/org/ideamark-core/patterns/example.yaml
  visibility: public
metadata:
  tags: [logistics, aging_population]
  scalefactor:
    timewindow: "2â€“5 years"
    spacemetrics: "urban neighborhood"
    regions: ["Shikoku"]
    organizations: ["city council"]
range:
  spatial: local
  temporal: short-term
  social_scope: community
granularity:
  level: strategic
reference:
  - label: Local Health Ordinance
    url: https://example.org/health-ordinance
    type: legal

  - type: observation
    description: Data collected from local clinic usage
    url: https://example.org/clinic-data
timeline:
  - entity: task:product-release
    year: 2023
    milestone: "\u4ed5\u69d8\u78ba\u5b9a"
    status: delayed
dependencies:
  - from: task:design
    to: task:implementation
    type: sequential
    risk: medium
observed_metrics:
  - entity: task:delivery
    metric: response_time
    average: "5d"
    stdev: "2d"
patterns:
  - type: delayed-decision
    occurred_in: ["task:x", "task:y"]
    severity: high
hypotheses:
  - text: "\u3053\u306e\u9045\u5ef6\u306f\u8a2d\u8a08\u5de5\u7a0b\u306e\u5c5e\u4eba\u6027\u304c\u539f\u56e0\u3067\u3042\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u9ad8\u3044"
    confidence: 0.7

```
**Tips:**
- Keep field names lowercase and snake_case
- Use plain strings or simple arrays â€” avoid deep nesting
- Use `linked_patterns`, `children`, or `relations` to structure the network

---

## ðŸ“„ Reference Format (`.ref.yaml`)

Reference entries are lightweight descriptors used for:

- Indexing
- Search & filtering
- Input to merge/synthesis tools
- Prompt input to LLMs

These files live in `/refs/` and contain a `ref:` key with a subset of fields.

### Example

```yaml
ref:
  id: IdeaMark-abc123-def456
  title: Localized Logistics Hub for Aging Communities
  access:
    uri: https://github.com/org/ideamark-core/patterns/local-logistics.yaml
    visibility: public
  metadata:
    tags: [mobility, health]
    scalefactor:
      timewindow: "1â€“3 years"
      regions: ["Tohoku"]
```

**Tips:**
- Match the `id` exactly with the source pattern
- Avoid redundancy â€” use only the fields needed for identification and filtering
- Keep ref files small (<1KB ideally)

---

## âœ… Best Practices

- One pattern = one `.yaml` file, one `.ref.yaml` file
- Match filenames: `example.yaml` and `example.ref.yaml`
- Use UUID-based `id` fields to ensure global uniqueness
- Validate pattern files against the schema before publishing

---

## Tooling Support

- Validation and merge tools are being added to `/tools/`
- LLM prompts can directly ingest `.ref.yaml` lists
- Conversion scripts (YAML â†” JSON â†” Markdown) are supported in community tools

---

IdeaMark formats are designed to be accessible, readable, and extensible â€” use them flexibly but consistently.
