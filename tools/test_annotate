  [From IdeaMark-9c5aad9c-7de7-4f3a-8b3e-452795654cd0] digital_commerce_model'
context:
- Difficulty sustaining local agricultural machinery service industry due to declining
  demand
- Declining profitability of coastal fisheries and difficulty attracting young fishers
problem:
  summary: '[From IdeaMark-aa85ca44-5dab-4e0f-b6a7-35f20260bd3b] Decreasing sales
    and maintenance contracts make it difficult to sustain rural service businesses

    [From IdeaMark-9c5aad9c-7de7-4f3a-8b3e-452795654cd0] Overreliance on wholesale
    markets leads to low margins and makes it difficult for new entrants'
solution:
  approach: '[From IdeaMark-aa85ca44-5dab-4e0f-b6a7-35f20260bd3b] Repurpose used agricultural
    machinery as shared regional mobility platforms, not limited to farming tasks

    [From IdeaMark-9c5aad9c-7de7-4f3a-8b3e-452795654cd0] Establish a fan-based subscription
    e-commerce model for direct shipping from ports'
